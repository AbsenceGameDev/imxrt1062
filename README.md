This is a bare-metal project for the [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) 4.0/4.1 board. 

The generated HEX file is compatible with the [Teensy Loader](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html).

# Credits
Linker files and startup code are based on the [Teensy Core Libraries for Arduino](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/cores) by Paul Stoffregen.
Initial idea from a fork I started working on yesterdayt, the repo (https://github.com/blazer82/baremetal-blinky.teensy) was a small baremetal example on a teensy 4.0 with a iMX.RT1060
