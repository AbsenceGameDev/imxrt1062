@DISCLAIMER! 
This todo is missing alot of finished entries. 
Some entries have been added after the fact and thus have been marked unknown on start/end timestamp.
It will be updated regularly from the point of upload to github. 


@NOTE: Maybe move to jira if things become too messy, but until then try to seperate with sections.  

// SYSTEM
✔ Get code compiled and sucessfully run a simple test program @done(21-02-08 11:40)
✔ Write code to handle the MPU @started(unknown) @done(unknown) @lasted()
✔ Move MPU code to a seperate file @started(21-04-12 13:49) @done(21-04-14 07:25) @lasted(1d17h36m5s)
✔ Set up interrupt vector @started(21-03-01 08:02) @done(21-03-02 18:19) @lasted(1d10h17m44s)
✔ Set up interrupt callbacks @started(21-03-01 12:20) @done(21-03-02 18:20) @lasted(1d6h38s)
☐ Set up a glopal pin array, will be used by the pin manager to notify which pins are already in use. Will need to keep track using arrays of pin_IDs @started(21-03-04 22:55)


// HEAP
☐ Regarding heap; why is READ_HEAP_FREEBLOCKS() reading 0 free blocks? INVESTIGATE, URGENT! @started(21-02-11 00:02)


// TIMERS
✔ Create a struct for managing timers @started(unknown) @done(unknown) @lasted()
✔ Fix timer manager to work properly with the different contexts @started(21-04-12 10:20) @done(21-04-12 13:48) @lasted(3h28m23s)

✔ Wirte code to handle PIT and GPT registers @started(unknown) @done(unknown) @lasted()
☐ PIT timers: Find out why they are not triggering the callback. Certainty is high that the issue lies with the callbacks. 
    Setting all the correct registers (I am pretty sure) and still nothing. I thought I had figured it out when I realized that 
    I had forgotten to tell the ccm to enable pit clocks, but it did not change the fact that the callbacks does not seem to be triggered
    I still need to find which register to set to tell it at which speed to run the PIT timer
    I am also quite certain that I have written some incorrect bitoperation macros for the pit and gpt registers 

    Ok so bitoperations have been fixed, and everything I have done seems to be in the correct order but it might be a power gating issue putting the clocks in inactive/disabled mode?


// GLYPHS 4x4
✔ Glyphs 4x4 digits @started(21-02-17 01:32) @done(21-02-17 01:47) @lasted(15m46s)

☐ Glyphs 4x4 defines to point to the glyphs @started(21-02-17 02:27)
☐ Glyphs 4x4 function or macro to split properly @started(21-02-17 01:47)
